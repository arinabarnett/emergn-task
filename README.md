# emergn-vue-task

Base part:

1. Create SPA using Vue.js
- Make a page of your liking that renders some list information (ToDo list, movie list etc.).
- When you click on one of items it displays some additional info about the item. You are free to choose appearance of your page, but don’t leave it plain, it should be interactive.
- It’s preferable if you use some fake API (for example [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), [http://dummy.restapiexample.com/](http://dummy.restapiexample.com/)).
- You should be able to search through the items, use methods that you developed in previous task.

Requirements:

- Use Vue Router and vuex. For UI we would like to see BootstrapVue, but it’s optional
- Use npm, preferably If project runs with `npm run start`
- Project should run on localhost
- Use git, host your project on GitHub.
- Optionaly host your app on GitHub pages

Optional part with increased difficulty (do as much as you can):

1. Using Webpack add CSS Pre/Post processors, JavaScript compiler (babel).
2. Replace fake API with your own.
